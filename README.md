# Mothership Character Gen
A random character generator for Tuesday Knight Games' sci-fi [Mothership TTRPG](https://www.mothershiprpg.com/), inspired by the MU-TH-UR 6000 computer from *Alien*. 

Heavily influenced by [this blog post](https://typesetinthefuture.com/2014/12/01/alien/) on the UX of *Alien* for providing font and style recommendations and [this blog post](https://dev.to/ekeijl/retro-crt-terminal-screen-in-css-js-4afh) for providing a starting point for the skeumorphic terminal design.
